# Contributions
 + It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. 
 + It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization.
 + It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. 
 + It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios.
 
# DataSets
 + IIIT-5K, Street View Text (SVT) and ICDAR datasets

# Comments
 This paper introduces a new framework for sequence labelling. The proposed approach is end-to-end trainable and is very elegant. Furthermore, it achieves good results on relevant datasets.
